# 🕯️ Candle
A cross-platform real-time global illumination renderer made with Rust 🦀 and wgpu.
</div>


## Goals 
- [ ] Performance: real-time global illumination with no additional setup from the user
- [ ] Compatability: support for older graphics cards without hardware raytracing
- [ ] Support for Bevy

## Limitations
- Made primarily for stylized games, it doesn't aim to be photorealistic (like Lumen or kajiya for example)
